## Current completed phase

Phase 3 — Standard Derived Character Values & Resources

## Git baseline

Foundation PR: [#1 feat: initialize COCSheet project foundation](https://github.com/DEATHTDM/COCSheet/pull/1)

Merged to `main` as `ac41a9a186d1b9d48d619390814ac3d3a82d1c72`.

## Implemented

- Vue 3 / TypeScript / Vite project with strict type checking
- Hash Router, Pinia, Dexie, Zod, Vitest, and pnpm
- `GPL-3.0-only` license
- five minimal SettingPack placeholders and a unified Setting Registry
- internal Extension Registry and allow-listed extension IDs
- minimal `Character`, `CreationSession`, and `CreationPreset` schemas
- Occupation schema, occupation point formula calculation, and attribute prerequisite validation foundations
- IndexedDB version 1 with `characters`, `creationSessions`, and `kpPresets`
- repositories for Character, CreationSession, creation workflow, and KP Preset
- basic Home, character creation/editor, and KP preset pages
- Character creation with a paired CreationSession in one transaction
- basic character list/delete, name autosave, and refresh persistence
- basic KP preset create/read/update/delete and refresh persistence
- Standard COC7 age input and six attribute generation methods: standard roll, low-roll boost, assign roll, multi roll, point buy, and manual
- injectable random source with testable D6, D10, D100, and general dice helpers
- player-controlled low-roll boost allocation and age reduction allocation
- pure age-band rules, sequential EDU improvement checks, Luck generation, and Half / Fifth calculation
- Base Characteristics → Age Adjustment → Final Characteristics derivation without destructive repeated deductions
- final `Character.age`, `Character.characteristics`, and `Character.luck` persistence
- strongly typed `CreationSession` attribute state with raw rolls, candidates, allocations, age processing, EDU history, and Luck source
- structured `CreationPreset.attributeGeneration` configuration with legacy `attributeMethods` read compatibility
- attribute workflow UI with basic information, attributes, occupation placeholder, restoration, and return-to-edit support
- hardening for mathematically feasible Assign Roll / Point Buy preset constraints
- restorable incomplete Manual drafts and minimum-allocation Point Buy drafts without premature Base Characteristics
- cross-field age consistency plus semantic validation for EDU improvement history and rolled Luck
- overwrite confirmations for regenerated attribute rolls, EDU history, and Luck rolls
- pure Standard COC7 derived rules for Maximum HP, Initial MP, Initial SAN, age-adjusted MOV, structured Damage Bonus, and Build
- read-only derived previews during attributes and resource summaries in the occupation placeholder
- optional strict Character resources containing only current HP, current MP, and current SAN
- atomic resource initialization when attributes complete, plus reset from new final characteristics after returning to edit
- explicit legacy Phase 2 resource initialization without Repository read side effects or Dexie version changes
- Character Store APIs for current HP constrained by Maximum HP, nonnegative integer current MP without an Initial MP cap, and current SAN constrained to 0～99, all with refresh persistence

## Foundation hardening

- Characteristic and Luck are separate at the type and Zod Schema level.
- Occupation formulas and attribute prerequisites accept Characteristic only, not Luck.
- persistent Character and KP Preset record metadata is checked against nested domain data.
- obsolete `occupationName` is absent and rejected by strict record validation.
- the attribute generation enum foundation is present.
- `OccupationSkillRequirement` is explicitly marked unfrozen pending real-data pressure tests.

## AttributeGenerationMethod implemented

Merged in the current enum:

- `standard-roll`
- `low-roll-boost`
- `assign-roll`
- `multi-roll`
- `point-buy`
- `manual`

## Not implemented

- skills and skill allocation
- occupation data and occupation UI
- independent final character sheet UI/module
- guide overlay
- import/export and printing/export
- URL / Hash preset sharing
- Setting-specific rules and full Setting content
- static-host deployment automation
- MP natural recovery rules and recovery limits

## Next intended work

No later phase is authorized by this document. Phase 4 remains planned only and requires a new explicit task.

## Known technical risks

- IndexedDB and domain Schema migration
- future import/export compatibility
- Setting-specific extension evolution
- Occupation schema not yet pressure-tested with full real data
- browser storage can be cleared, and long-term file backup is not implemented
